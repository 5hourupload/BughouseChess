Bughouse chess is a popular variation of chess. Bughouse is played with two boards and four players on two teams. Everytime you capture a piece from your opponent, you hand that piece to your teammate. Your teammate can then place the piece anywhere on their board as their turn!

There are many variations on the rules of bughouse, and the most popular ones are included, such as not being able to place pieces in checking positions, and allowing pieces to be placed on the first rank. The option to not have promoted pieces revert upon capture is also included.
